  // Micro-influencers
  {
    question: "What is The Social Market?",
    answer:
      "The Social Market is a place where micro-influencers and brands connect to grow authentically. You share products you genuinely love and get discovered by brands that value your influence.",
  },
  {
    question: "Who can join as a micro-influencer?",
    answer:
      "Anyone with a small to medium-sized social media audience who wants to share products they care about. Whether you have 50 followers or 50,000, your authentic voice matters. You don’t need to be a professional content creator — passion, creativity, and trustworthiness are what brands love.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do I have to pay to join?",
    answer:
      "Limited browsing the platform is free — you can explore a selection of brands and micro-influencers without signing up. To fully join and access all features, there’s a very low monthly subscription. Even better: the first 100 users get free lifetime access as a thank-you for helping us build the platform.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do I have to post on Instagram?",
    answer:
      "Nope! You can share content wherever your audience engages — YouTube, WhatsApp Status, or even your podcast!",
  },
  {
    question: "How do I set my rates for paid collaborations?",
    answer:
      "When creating your profile, you’ll see suggested ranges: Free, $0–$100, $101–$499, $500+, or a custom amount. Plus, in your profile you can indicate exactly how you’d like to get compensated. Brands will see your preferences and match you with campaigns that fit.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I work with multiple brands at the same time?",
    answer: "Absolutely! You can manage several campaigns at once.",
  },
  {
    question: "What happens after I sign up?",
    answer:
      "You’ll have full access to browse potential brands and you’ll be able to contact them with just a click. Once you fill out your profile, brands can find you and reach out to you as well!",
  },
  {
    question: "I don’t have a big following — can I still make money?",
    answer:
      "Totally! Many brands care more about engagement and authenticity than numbers. Even small, dedicated audiences can be very effective.",
  },
  {
    question:
      "I just want to repost a product to my WhatsApp Status or social feed — is that okay?",
    answer:
      "Yep. Many users start by sharing products on Status or social posts. You decide what to share and when, and brands will compensate you based on what you agree on.",
  },

  // Brands
  {
    question: "What types of brands succeed here?",
    answer:
      "Any size — from small to growing e-commerce businesses or mid-sized lifestyle brands. Popular categories include beauty, wellness, fashion, food, and nonprofit and lifestyle. Success comes from campaigns that resonate with influencers and their audiences.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do I create a campaign?",
    answer: `Creating a campaign is super easy! Just add your product or campaign details:
- Description of the product or service you offer
- Relevant Images or media for reposting
- Campaign type: Paid, gifted, or both
- Target audience filters (content niche, demographics, audience size, timezone)
- Suggested rates or budget
We’ve made it super simple to set up your campaign so that the right micro-influencers can find it quickly and start growing your brand immediately. Influencers can either repost your existing content, create original content, or do both — whatever works best for your campaign.`,
  },
  {
    question: "How do I match with the right micro-influencers?",
    answer:
      "You can filter by audience size, content niche, demographics, timezone, and compensation preference (paid, gift, or both). We’ve made this super easy — once you set the parameters, you’ll see influencers who match, so finding the right partners is fast and stress-free.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I offer free products instead of paying?",
    answer:
      "Yessss! One of the options for micro-influencers in their profile is how they want to get compensated — gifts only, paid only, or a mix. If an influencer only wants gifts, you can filter for that and only see matches who prefer gifting campaigns. Paid or mixed campaigns work the same way but are agreed on directly between the brand and influencer.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do I have to pay to join as a brand?",
    answer:
      "Limited browsing of potential influencers is free. Full access and campaign creation require a subscription. Early adopters (first 100 users) get free lifetime access.",
  },

  // Platform & General
  {
    question: "Do I need to choose between being a brand or micro-influencer?",
    answer:
      "Nope! Many users are both. You’ll just complete both profiles and have separate dashboards for each. And btw if you are both, we have a discount created specifically for you.",
  },
  {
    question:
      "I am running multiple campaigns and working with several different micro-influencers. How do I keep track of what’s working and which influencers are bringing results?",
    answer:
      "Once each campaign is live, the dashboards give analytics for engagement, reach, and performance, so you can see what’s working and optimize campaigns.",
  },
  {
    question: "What if I need help?",
    answer:
      "Support is always available! You can reach out to us anytime at [insert contact email or link] for assistance.",
